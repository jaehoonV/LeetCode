<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/keys-and-rooms/">841. Keys and Rooms</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><div>
<p>There are n rooms labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code> and all the rooms are locked except for room 0. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.

When you visit a room, you may find a set of <strong>distinct keys</strong> in it. Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.

Given an array <code>rooms</code> where <code>rooms[i]</code> is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room <code>i</code>, return <code>true</code> if you can visit <strong>all</strong> the rooms, or <code>false</code> otherwise.
