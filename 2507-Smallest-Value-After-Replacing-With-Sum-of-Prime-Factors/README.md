<p>You are given a positive integer <code>n</code>.

Continuously replace <code>n</code> with the sum of its <strong>prime factors</strong>.

<ul>
	<li>Note that if a prime factor divides <code>n</code> multiple times, it should be included in the sum as many times as it divides <code>n</code>.</li>
</ul>

Return the smallest value <code>n</code> will take on.
