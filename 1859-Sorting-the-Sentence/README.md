<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sorting-the-sentence/description/">1859. Sorting the Sentence</a></h2><h3>Easy</h3><hr><div>
<p>
A <strong>sentence</strong> is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters.

A sentence can be <strong>shuffled</strong> by appending the <strong>1-indexed word position</strong> to each word then rearranging the words in the sentence.

For example, the sentence <code>"This is a sentence"</code> can be shuffled as <code>"sentence4 a3 is2 This1"</code> or <code>"is2 sentence4 This1 a3"</code>.
Given a <strong>shuffled sentence</strong> <code>s</code> containing no more than <code>9</code> words, reconstruct and return the original sentence.
