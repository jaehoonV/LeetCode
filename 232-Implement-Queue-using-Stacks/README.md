<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/">232. Implement Queue using Stacks</a></h2><h3>Easy</h3><hr><div>
<p>Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty).
<ul>
	<li>void push(int x) Pushes element x to the back of the queue.</li>
	<li>int pop() Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.</li>
	<li>int peek() Returns the element at the front of the queue.</li>
	<li>boolean empty() Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.</li>
</ul>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.</li>
	<li>Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 <= x <= 9</code></li>
	<li>At most 100 calls will be made to push, pop, peek, and empty.</li>
	<li>All the calls to pop and peek are valid.</li>
</ul>
