<p>
There is a class with <code>m</code> students and <code>n</code> exams. You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> <code>m x n</code> integer matrix <code>score</code>, where each row represents one student and <code>score[i][j]</code> denotes the score the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> student got in the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> exam. The matrix <code>score</code> contains <strong>distinct</strong> integers only.

You are also given an integer <code>k</code>. Sort the students (i.e., the rows of the matrix) by their scores in the <code>k<sup>th</sup></code> (<strong>0-indexed</strong>) exam from the highest to the lowest.

Return the matrix after sorting it.
